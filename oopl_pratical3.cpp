/*
Imagine a publishing company which does marketing for book
and audiocassette versions.
 Create a class publication that stores the title (a string)
and price (type float) of a
 publication.From this class derive two classes: book, which
adds a page count(type int),
 and tape, which adds a playing time in minutes(type float).
 Write a program that instantiates the book and tape classes,
allows user to enter data and
 displays the data members.If an exception is caught, replace
all the data member values
 with zero values.

Title:  Demonstrate reusability of code thru Inheritance and use of exception handling

Theory:
Inheritance: C++ supports the concept of reusability once a class has been written and
tested, it can be adapted by other programmers to suit heir requirements. This is basically
done by creating new classes, reusing the properties of the existing ones. The mechanism
of deriving a new class from an old one is called inheritance. The old class is referred to
as base class or super class. And the new one is called as derived class or subclass.
Base Class &amp; Derived Class: When creating a class, instead of writing completely new
data members and member functions, the programmer can designate that the new class
should inherit the members of an existing class. This existing class is called the base
class, and the new class is referred to as the derived class. A derived class represents a
more specialized group of objects. Typically, a derived class contains behaviors inherited
from its base class plus additional behaviors. A class can be derived from more than one
class, which means it can inherit data and functions from multiple base classes.
To define a derived class, we use a class derivation list to specify the base class(es).
A class derivation list names one or more base classes and has the form:


Conclusion: Hence, we learnt to use and demonstrate concepts of inheritance and
exception handling.
